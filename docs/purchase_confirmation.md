# Purchase Confirmation Feature

## Overview
Added a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental purchases and implemented a recent purchases display feature.

## Features Added

### 1. Purchase Confirmation Dialog
- Prompts users to confirm their purchase before processing
- Shows product IDs being purchased
- Allows users to cancel purchases before they're processed
- Only appears for actual purchases (not for username-only inputs)

### Usage
- Enter username and product ID(s) in the quickbuy field
- Format: `username product_id [product_id2 ...]`
- Confirmation dialog appears showing products to be purchased
- Click "OK" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort

### 2. Form Submission Handling
- Prevents accidental double submissions
- Maintains original button disable functionality
- Preserves existing user experience while adding confirmation step

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
1. `stregsystem/static/js/quickbuy.js`:
   - Added form submission interceptor
   - Implemented confirmation dialog
   - Added purchase validation

2. `stregsystem/templates/stregsystem/index.html`:
   - Added script loading
   - Modified form handling

### Code Structure
javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
const form = document.getElementById('quickbuy-form');
if (form) {
form.addEventListener('submit', async function(event) {
// Purchase confirmation logic
// Form submission handling
});
}
});


## User Experience
1. User enters purchase information
2. System checks if it's a purchase (username + product ID)
3. If purchase:
   - Shows confirmation dialog
   - Processes purchase on confirmation
   - Cancels if user declines
4. If username only:
   - Proceeds to menu as normal

## Testing
To test the feature:
1. Navigate to the purchase page
2. Enter a username and product ID
3. Verify confirmation dialog appears
4. Test both confirmation and cancellation

## Notes
- Compatible with existing stregsystem functionality
- No database changes required
- Maintains original security features
- Preserves existing keyboard shortcuts
